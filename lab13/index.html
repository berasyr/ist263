            <h2>Syracuse University Student</h2>
            <p>I'm a 3rd-year student at Syracuse University, currently studying Information Technology with a minor in Finance & Computer Science.</p>
            <p>My interest regarding my major is in <strong>Project/Product Management.</strong> I love working with new products and hope to create my own someday. My accomplishments and achievements include having worked as an Internal Audit Technology & Operations Analyst at Citi, where I performed business monitoring, assisted with risk assessments, and contributed to scalable software applications. In my role as a Budget & Operations Assistant at Syracuse University's finance office, I managed budget modeling, financial reporting, and coordinated with various teams to achieve set goals.</p>
