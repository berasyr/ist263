            <p>This week’s GOAT discussion on Kevin Durant has highlighted the diverse ways we define greatness.

It's clear that greatness transcends measurable feats and is often intertwined with personal experiences, the cultural context of the time, and the unique legacy left behind. The GOAT debate will always continue, but that's part of what makes it so exciting—there’s no single, universally agreed-upon answer, and each perspective adds value to the conversation.</p>
